Analyzed a customer dataset in Excel by cleaning and organizing raw data, 
updating data types for accuracy, and applying sorting and filtering tools. 
Highlighted customers by credit limit and balance, identified top performers using descending and ascending sorts, 
and verified totals using Excel functions. 
This task demonstrates my ability to work with structured data, perform quality checks, and extract meaningful insights from spreadsheets.
